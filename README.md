**in-radius** is a proposal for a proximity based notification system, apparently it requires zero knowledge and experience in programming to get started.  
  
## Getting started  
  
To get started, you need to install the `locator` and the `transmitter`. These two are usually bundled together as one.  
  
The `locator` **must** be installed on the highest vantage point of your establishment where 360 degree viewing angle is possible.  
  
A list of `listener` should also be sent towards the `transmitter`, and by doing so, the `locator` would be able to send a signal back to `transmitter` notify the `listener` (mostly via SMS) that they are close to the establishment's radius.  

By implementing this architecture, we cut the expenses for building complicated systems by simply doing the the simplier way.
  
## Definition of terms  
  
* locator - a person who is willing to find `listener` from the top of the establishment, and usually gets paid for getting the job well done.
* transmitter - a device (usually a smartphone) that allows `locator` to read the list of `listener` from an app or send messages via SMS to `listener`.
* listener - a person who subscribed to the notification system, usually receives notification via SMS if the establishment is nearby.
